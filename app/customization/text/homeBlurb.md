For 35 years I have been caring for people in the hospital as a nurse, most recently in the postpartum unit. I have been fortunate enough to witness that–in spite of their pain, confusion and grief–people can find their own innate wisdom when they receive the emotional support they need. With an empathetic connection, their despair lightens. As their pain is acknowledged and their experiences are validated, people regain ease and vitality.

Do you feel alone or silenced? Do you find yourself suppressing your emotions, or feeling numb or detached? Are you emotionally exhausted and burnt out? If so, let’s talk. Together, we will find a way to make sense of your experiences, confusions, and pains.

My approach is gentle and direct. I will listen and offer you my caring attunement in a safe, non-judgmental, and supportive space. I will help you to reveal greater options and creativity as you face the challenges of your life, with the goal of finding self-awareness and peace.
